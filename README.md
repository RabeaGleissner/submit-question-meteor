# A Meteor app that manages question submissions
My first small Meteor.js app after completing the tutorial on meteor.com.

I taught myself some Meteor basics and then held a lesson on it during my web development course. I created this small app for my fellow students to log in with Twitter and submit a question for me during the lesson. 

The app identified my own Twitter credentials and gives me the additional option to classify and archive the questions.

## Technology used

Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS.
